# PHG-On-Windows

PHG(http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/phg/) is a parallel adaptive FEM platform designed by Prof. Linbo Zhang, LSEC. 
This is a windows binary version of the original source code phg-0.9.2, which includes 
related dynamic loading libraries and MSMPI. 
I have tested it for Clang and MSVC compilers. 
Now you can use Visual Studio IDE to develop PHG applications!
